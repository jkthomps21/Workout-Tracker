## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on any given day. I should be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
